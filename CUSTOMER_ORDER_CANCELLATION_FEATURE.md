### 2. Customer Cancellation Modal (`src/components/CustomerOrderCancellationModal.tsx`)
- **Customer-friendly interface** with clear explanations
- **Cancellation reasons** tailored for customers:
  - Changed my mind
  - Found a better price elsewhere
  - Ordered by mistake
  - Delivery taking too long

  - Address change required
  - Financial reasons
  - Quality concerns
  - Other (with details required)

- `pending`
- `confirmed`
- `processing`
- `assigned_to_delivery`
- `packed`

- `out_for_delivery`

### Non-Cancellable Orders
- Orders with status `delivered`
- Orders already `cancelled`
- Orders with status `returned`

3. **Initiate Cancellation**: Click "Cancel Order" button
4. **Select Reason**: Choose from customer-friendly cancellation reasons
5. **Provide Details**: Optional additional details (required for "Other")
6. **Confirm Cancellation**: Review order details and confirm
7. **Receive Confirmation**: Success message with refund timeline
8. **Updated Status**: Order status immediately updates to "cancelled"
