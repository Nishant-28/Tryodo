# Order Cancellation System - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Overview
The complete order cancellation system has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Tryodo platform. All components are working together seamlessly.

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. **getCancellationAnalytics Function Error**
- **Problem**: `DeliveryAPI.getCancellationAnalytics is not a function`
- **Root Cause**: Function was using old object method syntax instead of class static method syntax
- **Solution**: Converted all cancellation functions to proper static methods in the DeliveryAPI class

### 2. **Syntax Issues Fixed**
- Converted `getCancellationAnalytics: async (` â†’ `static async getCancellationAnalytics(`
- Converted `cancelOrder: async (` â†’ `static async cancelOrder(`
- Converted `getVendorCancelledOrders: async (` â†’ `static async getVendorCancelledOrders(`
- Converted `getDeliveryPartnerCancelledOrders: async (` â†’ `static async getDeliveryPartnerCancelledOrders(`
- Converted `canCancelOrder: async (` â†’ `static async canCancelOrder(`
- Converted `triggerCancellationNotifications: async (` â†’ `static async triggerCancellationNotifications(`

### 3. **Data Structure Alignment**
- Fixed field name mismatches between API response and component expectations
- Added proper fallback data for empty states
- Implemented comprehensive error handling
