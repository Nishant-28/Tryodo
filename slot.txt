Now, let me explain how the slot-based delivery system works in detail:

1. **Geographical Organization (Sectors)**:
   - The city/delivery area is divided into sectors (`delivery_sectors` table)
   - Each sector has:
     - A defined geographical boundary (stored as a polygon)
     - Active/inactive status
     - Capacity and operational parameters

2. **Time Management (Slots)**:
   - Each sector has multiple delivery slots (`delivery_slots` table)
   - Slots define:
     - Time window (start_time and end_time)
     - Day of week
     - Maximum order capacity
     - Sector association

3. **Order Flow**:
   a. **Order Creation**:
      - Customer selects a delivery slot during checkout
      - System checks slot availability using `check_slot_availability` function
      - Order is created with slot_id and sector_id

   b. **Order Assignment**:
      - `assign_slot_based_delivery` function runs periodically
      - Groups orders by sector and delivery date
      - Finds available delivery partners in each sector
      - Assigns orders optimizing for:
        - Delivery partner location
        - Slot timing
        - Order volume

   c. **Pickup Process**:
      - Delivery partner receives assigned orders
      - `mark_order_picked_up` function:
        - Updates order status
        - Records pickup time
        - Calculates estimated delivery time based on slot
        - Updates delivery partner status

   d. **Delivery Process**:
      - System tracks:
        - Order status
        - Delivery partner location
        - Time compliance with slots
        - Successful deliveries

4. **Optimization Features**:
   - Slot capacity management
   - Geographical clustering of orders
   - Delivery partner allocation based on:
     - Current location
     - Workload
     - Performance metrics

5. **Key Benefits**:
   - Predictable delivery windows
   - Optimized resource allocation
   - Better customer experience
   - Efficient route planning
   - Load balancing across time slots
