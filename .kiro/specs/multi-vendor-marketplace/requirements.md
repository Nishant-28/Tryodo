# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multi-Vendor Marketplace feature transforms the application into a modern quick commerce platform similar to Blinkit and Zepto, where multiple vendors can sell admin-curated products. The system features an admin-controlled product catalog with categories, brands, and products, allowing vendors to request approval to sell specific products at their own prices. Customers can browse, search, compare vendor offerings, and make purchases through an integrated cart and checkout system. Customer will see these products in www.tryodo.com/market page.
