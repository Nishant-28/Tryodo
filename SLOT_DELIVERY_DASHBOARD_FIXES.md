# Slot-Based Delivery Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Numeric Field Validation Error (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: `invalid input syntax for type numeric: ""`
- The `delivery_partner_orders` table has numeric fields (`delivery_fee`, `distance_km`, `payment_collection_amount`) that were being passed empty strings instead of proper numeric values.

**Solution**: Modified all insert operations in `src/lib/deliveryApi.ts` to use proper numeric values:
- `delivery_fee: 0` instead of empty string
- `distance_km: null` instead of empty string (for optional fields)
- `payment_collection_amount: 0` instead of empty string

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/deliveryApi.ts` - Fixed 4 locations where `delivery_partner_orders` records are created

### 2. Enhanced Slot-Based Delivery Dashboard
**Problem**: The delivery dashboard was not properly supporting the slot-based delivery system, causing vendor pickup failures.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the delivery dashboard (`src/pages/DeliveryPartnerDashboard.tsx`) with:

#### Key Improvements:
1. **Proper Slot-Based Loading**: 
   - Loads orders based on delivery slot assignments
   - Supports both `delivery_partner_sector_assignments` and `delivery_assignments` tables
   - Filters slots by time with appropriate buffers

2. **Fixed Delivery Partner Assignment Creation**:
   - Automatically creates missing `delivery_partner_orders` records
   - Uses the new `ensureDeliveryPartnerAssignment` function with proper numeric values
   - Handles edge cases where orders exist in slots but lack partner assignments

3. **Enhanced Vendor Pickup Logic**:
   - Improved error handling with specific error messages
   - Better vendor grouping and pickup status tracking
   - Proper progress calculation for slot completion

4. **Improved Data Loading**:
   - Separated complex joins to avoid 400 errors
   - Loads vendor data, pickup status, and order items separately
   - Better error handling and recovery

#### New Features:
- **Slot Status Tracking**: Shows pickup and delivery progress for each slot
- **Sequential Slot Restriction**: Ensures slots are completed in order
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Refreshes data every 30 seconds
- **Better Mobile UI**: Improved responsive design for delivery partners

### 3. API Function Fixes
Enhanced several functions in `src/lib/deliveryApi.ts`:

1. **`ensureOrderDeliveryPartnerAssignment`**: 
   - Fixed numeric field issues
   - Added proper error handling
   - Improved assignment status logic

2. **`markVendorPickedUp`**: 
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Improved pickup record creation logic
   - Fixed assignment validation

3. **`debugAndFixMissingAssignment`**: 
   - Added numeric field fixes
   - Better error reporting

## Database Schema Impact

The fixes ensure proper data types are used for numeric fields in `delivery_partner_orders` table:
- `delivery_fee` (numeric): Now uses `0` instead of empty string
- `distance_km` (numeric): Now uses `null` instead of empty string 
- `payment_collection_amount` (numeric): Now uses `0` instead of empty string

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Vendor Pickup Flow**:
   - Assign delivery partner to a slot with multiple vendors
   - Try marking vendors as picked up
   - Verify no 400/406 errors occur

2. **Test Slot Progression**:
   - Verify slots appear in correct order
   - Check that previous slot completion logic works
   - Test slot status transitions (assigned → picking_up → delivering → completed)

3. **Test Missing Assignment Recovery**:
   - Create orders in slots without delivery partner assignments
   - Verify dashboard automatically creates missing assignments
   - Check that numeric fields are properly set

## Files Modified

1. **`src/pages/DeliveryPartnerDashboard.tsx`** - Complete rewrite for slot-based system
2. **`src/lib/deliveryApi.ts`** - Fixed numeric field issues in 4 functions:
   - `ensureOrderDeliveryPartnerAssignment`
   - `debugAndFixMissingAssignment` 
   - `acceptOrder`
   - `fixMissingDeliveryPartnerAssignments`

## Key Benefits

1. **Eliminates 400/406 Errors**: Fixed numeric field validation issues
2. **Proper Slot-Based Flow**: Dashboard now properly supports the slot delivery system
3. **Better Error Handling**: More descriptive error messages and recovery mechanisms
4. **Improved Performance**: Separated complex queries to avoid timeouts
5. **Enhanced UX**: Better progress tracking and status indicators for delivery partners

The delivery dashboard now fully supports the slot-based delivery system with proper error handling and automatic recovery mechanisms.
